%==================================================================

This project has started as my "lockdown" project for 2020 and
2021, and since then has been lingering on the back burner, until I could finally 
finish it. Besides from having the opportunity, the main motivation was
what I perceive as a change of typographical convention in
contemporary stellar atlasses, something that, at least in my opinion,
has led to an increasing visual blandness in those works over the 20th
century (which, I acknowledge, may make it much easier to actually
work with those modern atlasses).

The design draws strong typographical inspiration from the "Tabulae
Caelestes" by Schurig/G\"otz (first edition 1886, last edition 1973),
which already drew such inspiration from earlier works, such as the
"Vorstellung der Gestirne" by J.~E.~Bode (1782, see
\url{https://www.lsw.uni-heidelberg.de/foerderkreis/bode/index2_e.html})
and ultimately the "Atlas Coelestis" by Flamsteed (1729, see
\url{https://www.rct.uk/collection/1059272/atlas-coelestis}).  The
University of Latvia has very nice scans of the 1909 edition of the
Tabulae on their pages, although one panel seems missing:

Later editions also included a lunar map, which I, however, have no
intention to add.

I deliver two versions, one in the original and traditional order and
orientiation, suitable for the Northern hemisphere. Since I am based in
Chile, however, I found it useful to add some modifications and
re-ordering to create a Southern hemisphere version: Firstly, the
polar plates are re-ordered such that the Southern pole comes first;
secondly, the equatorial sequence of plates has been rotated by 180
degrees, as seen by an observer south of the equator; and thirdly the
origin for the equatorial sequence has been changed from the
traditional Northern spring equinoctial point in Pisces to the
Southern one, in Virgo. To my knowledge, this is the only celestial
atlas that makes such adaptations for the convenience of Southern
hemisphere observers.

%==================================================================
%Purpose/usage
%==================================================================
I have been using the maps of the original "Tabulae Caelestes" for a
number of purposes:

- Naked eye orientation in parts of the sky without prominent
  constellations.
- Getting a general idea where objects of interest are in the sky*.
- Rough observation planning (what is accessible when in the night)*.
- Orientation in the night/on sky for wide-field astrophotography.

*): Even for professional astronomers.

%LaTeX issues
%==================================================================

While the full source files are available here, as well as the
results, the compilation only works for the atlas_N.tex and
atlas_S.tex files. Overleaf cannot actually compile the panels for the
project for two reasons:

- It times out with one minute (at least in the free version), which
  is curious, since even my elderly laptop finishes the job in about 40 seconds per
  panel.

- Even in the paid version, it fails with "TeX capacity exceeded" message. So
  to compile the project, this has to be downloaded and done locally. For a
  texlive installation, the capacity of a local installation can be adapted to
  compile the project by installing the provided {\tt texmf.cnf} into the
  appropriate place. In detail, the local {\tt texmf.cnf} adaptations should
  be:
  \begin{verbatim}
  extra_mem_bot = 3000000     % extra low memory for boxes, glue, breakpoints, etc.
  extra_mem_top = 3000000     % extra high memory for chars, tokens, etc.
  main_memory = 8000000 % words of inimemory available; also applies to inimf&mp
  \end{verbatim}
  
As a consequnce, the project is uploaded with all panel pdf-files
pre-compiled, that would otherwise be generated by overleaf. Also,
final versions of the full atlas are available under the names
final_N.pdf and final_S.pdf.

The atlas is formatted for printing on A3 paper. On a smaller
paper format, detail will be lost, due to a physical minimum width of
printed lines and such.

%Sources
%==================================================================

The maps show stars brighter than $V=6.5$\,mag that were filtered from
the $5^{\rm th}$ version of SKY2000 Master Catalog \citep[][(catalog
number V/145 in the VizieR service]{2015yCat.5145....0M}. This catalog
also provides Bayer and Flamsteed designations, which are shown for
all stars brighter than $V=6$\,mag, unless in crowded places. Also the
variability and binarity flags were taken from the SKY2000 by
evaluating variability type and WDS cross-identification given there.

For the brightest stars, common names were selected from
\citet[][(catalog number IV/27A in the VizieR
service]{2004yCat.4027....0K} and are shown along with the Bayer
designations.

The constellation boundaries were taken from \citep[][(catalog number
VI/49 in the VizieR service]{1997yCat.6049....0D}, as precessed to
J2000. To avoid double printing, the subset selected by Pierre Barbier
\url{http://pbarbier.com/constellations/boundaries.html} was used.

Nebulae were selected based on magnitude from the SKY2000.0 catalog
\citep[][(catalog number VII/118 in the VizieR
service]{1988cngc.book.....S}. Messier numbers were assigned manually,
where applicable.

Positions and sizes for some other objects of interest, like local
dwarf galaxies, the Galactic center etc.\ were taken from the SIMBAD
service \url{http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-fid}.

The Galactic intensity contours were extracted from the d3-celestial project,
which was released under the BSD-3 license at
\url{https://github.com/ofrohn/d3-celestial} (Copyright 2015, Olaf
Frohn). This references the MW outline data back to Jos\'e R. Vieira from Sao
Paulo as source, but I was not able to find the original data or article.

SMC and LMC I traced myself, in a very rough manner, from the Aladin Sky Atlas at
\url{http://aladin.cds.unistra.fr/aladin.gml}

For the licences of the source materials see there.

I am sure many improvements can be made; to enable this most easily (and since
I believe the modern copyright and patent system is hindering
progress, rather than fostering it, as was originally intended; see,
for instance,
\url{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1411328} or \url{https://source.wustl.edu/2009/03/economists-say-copyright-and-patent-laws-are-killing-innovation-hurting-economy/}), I
release my own contributions into the public domain.
